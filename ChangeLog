	- Constraint students (set) max gaps per week
	- Constraint students (set) early max beginnings at second hour
	- Subject tags are now named correctly activity tags
	- Constraints students set/teacher home room(s)
	- Buildings, building changes constraints
	- Constraint activities same starting day
	- Teachers, students sets, rooms, breaks not available matrices
	- Updated Romanian, Greek, Italian, Arabic translations by the persons in charge
- Version 5.5.1
	- Improved handling of multiple constraints preferred room for same activity (or same
	subject or same subject+activity tag) - suggested by Volker Dirr.
	- Improved Romanian translation.
	- Small improvements in the interface.
- Version 5.5.2
	- Small improvements in the interface.
	- Updated German and Indonesian translation.
	- Possibility to save current timetable in .fet form, with activities locked on their places
	(suggested by Horatiu Halmajan)
- Version 5.5.3
	- Crash bug fix - when adding a year with same name as a group or subgroup (reported by Volker Dirr)
	- Small interface improvements
	- Added checks to ensure that duplicate students sets are reported (suggested by Volker Dirr)
- Version 5.5.4
	- Greek, Romanian, Spanish translations updates
	- Small interface improvements
	- Added constraint 2 activities ordered, to allow to say: activity A2 must be after A1, separated
	by any number of days or hours (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added constraint teacher(s) max hours continuously (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added constraint students (set) max hours continuously (suggested by kdsayang)
	- When modifying a constraint min n days between activities, it checks for duplicates (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Crash bug fix (rare, if using home rooms with weight under 100% and rooms are constrained)
	- Added more tests to ensure home rooms inputted correctly
	- Generating multiple now saves each timetable in .fet form (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Increased number of days per week to 28, to allow exam scheduling (suggested by kdsayang)
- Version 5.5.5
	- Very small bug fix (very unlikely to happen, also the effect is almost null)	
	- Indonesian, Spanish and Arabic translation updates
	- Added an additional check for inconsistency
- Version 5.5.6
	- Arabic, Romanian, Spanish, Italian translations update.
	- Added an option to select all slots available or not available for constraints break, not available and preferred times
	(suggested by didit).
	- Added another Arabic sample by Silver
- Version 5.5.7
	- Added 2 samples from Namibia (by Bobby Wise).
	- Added 1 sample from Namibia (by Willy Henckert).
	- Arabic and Greek translations updates.
	- Bug fix - now inactivating some activities allows to generate the timetable, because constraints referring to
	these activities are ignored (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Improvement - activating/deactivating activities for a year/group considers also the activities of included groups/subgroups
	(suggested by Yush Yuen).
- Version 5.5.8
	- Bug fix - when saving a timetable, regenerating it might give an impossible timetable - reported by Yush Yuen.
	This bug solved other possible important bug (I doubt someone observed this bug. What happens: if an
	activity has a fixed time, then when FET allocates it it fixes a room for this activity and consequent
	changes are not possible to reschedule this activity to another room - might give impossible timetable in extreme cases).
	Now it is possible to reallocate the room to another slot.
	- Improved add activity dialog - if min days is x (greater than 1) and weight is lower than 100.0%, user can add
	a second constraint with x-1 min days, to ensure activities are better separated.
	- Added advice to remove redundant min n days constraints when adding same starting time constraints.
	- Added another sample by Yush Yuen.
- Version 5.5.9
	- Added constraint activity(ies) preferred STARTING times, the old preferred times constraints are renamed preferred time slots
	and are more correct now, taking into consideration the duration of each activity (reported by Volker Dirr).
	- Allowing more constraint activity preferred starting times (or preferred time slots) for same activity id,
	which was restricted by a bug to only one. You can add more constraints with different weights.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.6.0 - 5.6.4
- Version 5.6.0
	- Added import/export CSV (text with comma separated values) filters by Volker Dirr.
	- Added constraint min gaps between activities (suggested by several users).
	- Add activity dialog, checking/unchecking show years/groups/subgroups does not erase inserted sets (suggested by Zsolt Udvari).
	- Small bug fix when importing activities, consecutive if same day is not correctly imported (reported by daviodan).
	- Added Romanian help for export/import by daviodan.
- Version 5.6.1
	- Crash bug fix (probably very rare).
	- Added possibility to change easier more constraints min n days between activities
	- Added constraints subactivities preferred time slots and subactivities preferred starting times
	(suggested by Volker Dirr). You can specify the component number for subactivities, useful for constraining courses,
	say only the first or the last components of a split activity to be placed earlier.
	- Switched to Qt 4.4.0 and gcc 4.3.1
	- Indonesian, Romanian, Italian, German translations updates.
- Version 5.6.2
	- Added constraint teacher(s) and students (set) interval max days per week, to specify an hourly interval
	and the maximum number of days per week for teachers (students) to work in this interval (suggested by Silver).
	This constraint is very useful, for instance specify that teachers and students must not work more than 2
	times per week in the last hour of the day.
	- Added constraint a set of activities end students day - to specify for a group of activities that they
	should end the day for students (for instance for meetings with the class master) - suggested by Zsolt Udvari.
	- Bug fix - when modifying a constraints (sub)activities preferred starting times or time slots, the activity tag
	is now correctly updated.
- Version 5.6.3
	- Crash bug fix (probably rare)
	- Added an -x- in the not available slots in teachers', students' and rooms' timetables
	(suggested by George Miliotis), added by Volker Dirr.

- Version 5.6.4
	- Improved Arabic, Lithuanian and Italian translations.
	- Improved a very very rare situation (raised the maximum number of retries for a single activity from 100,000 to 200,000.
	This way, some saved timetables which contain constraints with weights close to 100% and below 100% (like 99.995%) are possible.
	Probably this situation is unnoticed by anybody). The possible problem is not perfectly solved, but it is a compromise.
	- Added possibility to mark or not -x- in the not available slots in timetables (suggested by Silvia, done by Volker Dirr).
	- Added all activities timetables by Volker Dirr (suggested by kdsayang)
	- Added exporting of timetable in csv form by Volker Dirr
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.7.0 - 5.7.7

	- Added 2 more samples by Cristian Balint
	- Small bug fix in statistics exported as html, by Volker Dirr
- Version 5.7.3
	- Modified a bit the spreading activities dialog, now the activities split into 2 and 3 not in consecutive days
	is by default NOT checked, because this might lead to impossible timetables for difficult files. If you want
	spreading for these activities, you need to manually select this option.
	- Arabic translation update by Silver
- Version 5.7.4
	- Minor bug fix - if searching for updates at startup is enabled, it gave segmentation fault when exiting FET, under GNU/Linux.
	Probably unnoticed bug.
	- Switched to Qt 4.4.3
	- Added a user's manual by Volker Dirr
	- Spanish translation update by Jose Cesar Fernandez Lopez
	- Added an additional sample file by Horatiu Halmajan (Faculty of Economics, Timisoara, Romania)
- Version 5.7.5
	- Added constraint 2 activities grouped, which is the non-oriented version of constraint 2 activities consecutive
	(the activities can be placed in any order, but one near the other) (suggested by sherman)
	- Added an additional test to ensure that constraints same starting time are not impossible
	- Very minor bug fixes (when working with redundant constraints same starting time/day/hour). This bug
	is most probably unnoticed.
	- Added an additional sample file by Zsolt Udvari (Bethlen, Hungary).
- Version 5.7.6
	- Minor interface improvements
	(Command line version now has the parameter "htmllevel", the old one was
	"timetablehtmllevel", which still works. Added description in the README file of the default values.
	Other interface improvements).
- Version 5.7.7
	- Minor improvements (the settings are now saved in a file which does not contain spaces under GNU/Linux,
	other improvements).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.8.0 - 5.8.1

	- Added the possibility to view locked activities in the timetables and toggle lock/unlock activities in the timetable
	(suggested by Azu Boba, implemented by Liviu Lalescu and Volker Dirr).
	- Added the possibility to lock/unlock the activities of a certain day
	(suggested by Azu Boba, implemented by Liviu Lalescu and Volker Dirr).
	- Added the possibility to lock/unlock the activities which end students day
	(suggested by Volker Dirr, implemented by Liviu Lalescu).
	- The constraints activity preferred starting time and activity preferred room have now an attribute, which
	can mean that some constraints are added permanently by the human operator and cannot be unlocked from the view timetable
	form (suggested by Azu Boba, done by Liviu Lalescu and Volker Dirr).
	- Minor bug fixes (very rare crashes).
	- Minor improvements - when viewing the timetable, the detailed activity view is updated correctly
	(suggested by Jose Cesar Fernandez Lopez).
	- Other minor interface improvements.
	- Minor improvements.
	- Repaired the Turkish translation (by Liviu Lalescu), but it is still old and incomplete.
	- Added the output of activities timetable as xml
- Version 5.8.1
	- Minor improvements (code cleanup) - modified a bit the xml files to contain for boolean variables only true/false values
	instead of yes/no (following xml format recommendations).
	- Minor improvement: the constraint activity preferred starting time must have now the day and the hour both specified,
	so there is a clearer distinction between preferred starting time and preferred starting times.
	- Minor improvement - when reading some kind of invalid data, instead of crashing, now FET reports the error
	(like for instance duplicate teachers, or subjects, or wrong tags).
	- Minor improvements in the Italian, Arabic and Spanish translations.
	- Added a sample file from Azu Boba.
	- The index.html links now open in the same window (suggested by daviodan).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.9.0 - 5.9.4

	- It is now possible to edit a single subactivity.
	- Added constraints teacher(s) or students (set) activity tag max hours continuously (to specify that
	a teacher or a students set must have maximum n hours continuously for an activity tag) - suggested by Silver,
	George Miliotis and Volker Dirr.
	- Improved a bit the memory consumption.
	- To avoid problems with very large filenames, the sample file names were shortened.
	- Minor html timetables corrections (cosmetic).
	- Updates in Spanish, Arabic, Romanian and Italian translations.
	- Minor improvements.
- Version 5.9.1
	- Improved a situation for fixed timetables which were impossible sometimes (reported by Horatiu Halmajan). This bug is
	not entirely fixed.
	- Improved the html timetables by Volker Dirr.
	- Crash bug fix for constraint min gaps between activities with weight below 100%.
	- Bug fix in students early constraint - not critical bug.
	- Updates in Arabic translation.
- Version 5.9.2
	- Crash bug fix when importing activities (reported by Thomas Schwartz).
	- Improvements and corrections in the import filter.
- Version 5.9.3
	- Added constraint activity tag preferred room(s) - suggested by Horatiu Halmajan and Catalin Maican
- Version 5.9.4
	- Added the Russian translation (incomplete) - by Ilya V. Paramonov
	- Added the Persian translation (incomplete) - by Hamed SadeghiNeshat
	- Minor bug fix by Volker Dirr - highlighting the same teacher or student set, for html level >= 5, did not work
	correctly for advanced statistics export.
	- Improved compilation time and memory consumption by modifying the data reading and parsing routines
	(additional checking/tests needed here).
	- Minor memory leak fix (normally, not noticeable).
	- Minor interface bug fix (description of constraint teacher max gaps per day displayed incorrectly information about the
	gaps, writing "per week" instead of "per day").
	- Modified the order of search for translation files (firstly in current directory, then in current directory/translations,
	then, under systems which support it, in /usr/share/fet/translations).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.10.0 - 5.10.3
- Version 5.10.0
	- Leaking bugs fixed (closed Qt widgets were not removed).
	- Bug fix in generation algorithm. This bug is not seen in practice, but the code in generate.cpp was incorrect in a minor portion.
	Specifically, it corrected tests done when the user has constraints of type students early max beginnings at second hour,
	without max gaps per week for students, with max or min hours daily for students.
	- Added constraint teachers max days per week (suggested by Marco Barsotti).
	- Made the results directory customizable (user can choose it) - suggested by Massimo Mancini.
	- Fixed a bug: if user deactivated some activities, in some cases he could not generate a timetable (if using preferred times
	for (sub)activities).
	- Added a filter in add and modify dialogs constraints activities not overlapping (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Added a new feature in the timetable generate dialog, which allows you to see the time when the highest
	number of activities was placed (suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Added a Catalan translation of the manual, by Joan de Gracia.
	- Changed the name of the html timetable files.
	- Corrected many translations' layout (by Liviu Lalescu).
	- Added a new test for inconsitency for indirect links between constraints actvities same starting time
	(suggested by Silvia).
	- Minor improvement - in students statistics menu, user can select to view complete structure (duplicates enabled)
	or canonical structure.
	- Interface improvement - dialogs when removing the constraints or adding them are improved, so that they are not
	very large for large constraints.
	- Selection mode in constraints not available and preferred slots is improved - you can click table header
	(suggested by Massimo Mancini).
	- Minor other interface improvements.
	- Export warns if existing files (suggested by Angela).
	- Changed directory of sample inputs to 'examples'.
	- Added a 'Related' checkbox in activities and subactivities dialogs (suggested by Bingen).
	- Speed improvement in some precomputing situations (not in generation).
	- Improved size for constraints with combo boxes of very large activities (suggested by Bingen).
- Version 5.10.1
	- Speed improvement if user has constraints activities same starting time. Idea and partial code by Volker Dirr.
	- Added possibility to print activities with same starting time in the html timetables (suggested on the forum, implemented by Volker Dirr).
	- Minor interface improments under GNU/Linux. The combo boxes are now smaller.
	- Modified the main menu arrangement of constraints (suggested by Massimo Mancini).
	- Crash bug fix (very rare, if user pressed cancel immediately after hitting generation start in timetable generate dialog).
	- Added another sample file (by T. Renganathan).
- Version 5.10.2
	- Speed improvement if user has constraints activities same starting time, 2 activities consecutive and 2 activities ordered and
	 activities not overlapping (idea and partial code by Volker Dirr). In some cases, the speed improvement is very high. This has to
	 do with the initial ordering of the activities.
	- Other minor speed improvements (idea and partial code by Volker Dirr).
	- Added a Persian manual by Hamed SadeghiNeshat.
- Version 5.10.3
	- Added 2 new constraints: three activities grouped, max days between activities (suggested by Zsolt Udvari).
	- Improved the names of constraints: "2" activities grouped, ordered and consecutive are now "two" activities grouped, ordered and consecutive.
	- Code cleanup.
	- Added a new Italian sample file, by Marco.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.11.0
- Version 5.11.0
	- Updated to Qt 4.5.2
	- Converted all dialogs to Qt 4 Designer files - suggested by George Miliotis.
	Compilation time is now shorter and intermediary and executable files are smaller.
	- Added constraint teacher(s) min days per week (suggested by several users).
	- Added constraint teacher(s) or students (set) for an activity tag maximum hours daily (suggested by several users).
	It is not perfect and must be enabled from settings menu.
	- Added constraint students (set) max gaps per day. It is not perfect and must be enabled from settings menu.
	- Very rare crash bug fix (reported by Marco Barsotti).
	- Constraint room not available times permits now multiple constraints for the same room (so, you can use multiple constraints with
	 different weights and preferences for the same room).
	- In add/modify activity and modify subactivity dialogs, the students are displayed in a tree-like structure (suggested by George Miliotis).
	- In all constraints dialogs, added a nice filter (suggested by daviodan).
	- Changed name of constraint: MinNDaysBetweenActivities becomes MinDaysBetweenActivities.
	- Added a count for activities list and constraints list.
	- The constraints with tables now contain an X (nicer look), also centered nicely, and they have colors (which can be enabled in settings)
	- The timetables view forms now center text in cells.
	- Many other minor interface improvements.
	- Rewritten the Catalan translation by Silvia. It is very complete, check it out.
	- Added a new Greek sample file, by George Miliotis.
	- Updated and improved Persian translation by sally sat.
	- Dropped !DOCTYPE FET tag in the .fet files - following general recommendations, and changed FET tag to fet tag. Of course you can open older files.
	- Improved activities simple description (suggested by Massimo Mancini and Chafik Graiguer).
	- Added possibility to save the highest stage timetable (suggested by Chafik Graiguer, pinco and Massimo Mancini).
	- Added a new Romanian sample file, by Horatiu Halmajan.
	- Updated translations: Russian, German, Romanian, Italian, Spanish.
	- The timetable view dialogs now have resizeable widgets (you can drag the sections with the mouse) - suggested by Ben Bauer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.12.0 - 5.12.3
- Version 5.12.0
	- Added shortcut buttons on the main form (suggested by more users, especially: daviodan, Massimo Mancini, Paolo Cataldi). They can be deactivated from Settings - Interface menu.
	- Increased max activities to 15,000, max days per 'week' to 35, and other limits, and improved memory management. Now you don't need to have much virtual memory and memory usage is lower.
	This better memory management may bring a small slowdown of the generation, although in rare cases the new version may be faster. Speed variation depends also on the platform.
	More details about the possible slowdown: I compared times by starting parallel generations with the same random seed, which produces the same timetables in identical steps.
	I noticed usually less than 10% increased generating time, but in rare cases for some unusual files a bit more, maximum 17%.
	From the official examples, the worst situation is for the file Hungary/Bethlen/2007-2008-difficult/Bethlen_2007_2008.fet, with about 17% slowdown from FET version 5.11.0 to FET 5.12.0.
	I apologise for this "downgrade" of speed, but it is necessary.
	- Updated to Qt 4.6.0
	- Improved add activity dialog, by Volker Dirr: if in activities dialog, you select a filter and then try to add an activity, the values in this filter
	will be selected in the add activity dialog (this was also suggested by daviodan).
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Changed help management (added links to online help).
	- Corrected/updated translations.
	- Code cleanup.
- Version 5.12.1
	- Added Ukrainian translation (by Andriy Melnyk).
	- Bug fix: when modifying the number of students in a students set, the related activities will show the correct number of students, but the generation
	will consider the old number of students until the user saves and loads again the file.
	- Bug fix when adding/modifying a group's/subgroup's number of students, now all groups/subgroups with same name will have the same (new) number of students.
	- Improved speed of loading for large files and blocked user input while loading a larger file, because otherwise the user could obtain an incomplete file
	(minor bug reported by Volker Dirr).
	- Minor interface improvement: when exiting FET and choosing Save file, if you press Cancel, FET will not exit anymore - reported by Soyeb Aswat
	- Minor interface improvement: added a shortcut button to advanced functions in Time shortcuts section.
	- Minor leak fixed (when removing a group or subgroup).
	- Other minor bug fixes, when removing a group or a year.
- Version 5.12.2
	- Updated to Qt 4.6.1 .
	- Minor interface improvement: since a person reported he accidentally removed the basic constraints, it was added additional user confirmation for this, and more user information.
	- Corrected a possible compiling crash bug under MinGW (this is not a FET bug, it is a MinGW bug). It was made a hack to overpass this bug.
	- Improved export of timetable as CSV, by adding the id-s of the activities (suggested by m).
- Version 5.12.3
	- Crash bug fix for a rare situation, in which you have constraints (sub)activities preferred starting times or time slots and they refer to no activity (reported by George Miliotis).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.13.0 - 5.13.5
- Version 5.13.0
	- Updated to Qt 4.6.2.
	- For constraints students (set) min hours daily is now possible to allow empty days (in advanced usage) - suggested by Horatiu Halmajan and Catalin Maican.
	- Added a simple activity planning form, by Volker Dirr (see Advanced menu).
	- Now it is allowed to have 3 constraints of type interval max days per week for each students subgroup or teacher (it was maximum 2 previously).
	- Added export of active activities, by Volker Dirr.
	- Added Brazilian Portuguese translation (partial, incomplete yet), by Werner Bruns and Frank Martin.
	- Added Danish translation (partial, only the main form and a few other forms), by David Lamhauge.
	- Improved a bit the memory consumption.
	- The tables contain now an -x- (lowercase) if the teacher/students set/room is not available and -X- (uppercase) for a break (suggested by George Miliotis).
	Also, you can configure separately if you want breaks displayed and/or not available displayed.
	- Removed some useless messages, improving speed for some rare cases under GNU/Linux operating system and similar.
	- Added a few new sample files (by Christoph Schilling, Horatiu Halmajan and aliponte).
	- Changed default language/locale to en_US (instead of en_GB).
- Version 5.13.1
	- Corrected a generation bug (probably very rare, it gave impossible timetable). Bug may have appeared if using
	constraints students (set) early with max beginnings at second hour >= 1 and generating on a locked file.
	- Increased maximum number of teachers, subjects, rooms and buildings to 6000 (they were 3000 previously).
	- Corrected some HTML minor problems, by Volker Dirr.
	- Added a new sample file, by Chafik Graiguer (from Morocco). This user also describes tricks to use official FET for Moroccan schools.
- Version 5.13.2
	- Increased max activities from 15,000 to 30,000 (suggested by murad). Also, increased max time constraints from 30,000 to 60,000 and max space constraints from 30,000 to 60,000.
	- Added a partial Sinhala translation (only the main menu), by Achini Duisna.
	- Updated the Indonesian translation, by Nirwan Yus.

- Version 5.13.5
	- Corrected a bug, under newer versions of GNOME (the locked/unlocked icons for the special constraints were not shown in the menus).
	- Very rare bug fix (crash in import if some fields in a line are missing, reported by murad).
	- Other minor bug fixes in import (if an imported line was incorrect, the report message didn't specify this line number, in some cases).
	- Updated the Indonesian translation, by Nirwan Yus.
	- Updated the Spanish translation, by Jose Cesar Fernandez Lopez.
	- Code cleanup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions 5.14.0 - 5.14.5
- Version 5.14.0
	- Improved the random number generator, so that potential cycling problems are avoided (though probably nobody met such problems).
	The new random number generator has a much longer period and is better. The command line parameters for specifying the random
	seed are changed and you need to change your script if you use FET command line and if you want to specify the random seed.
	See the README file for the new command line parameters for specifying the random seed.
	- Improved memory consumption on constraints activity/activities/subactivities preferred starting times/preferred time slots.
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Updates in the Arabic translation, by Silver.
- Version 5.14.1
	- Speed improvement in the generation algorithm (this speed improvement is better observable as the number of hours per week is larger).
	- Added a partial Hebrew translation, by Yotam Medini (only the main menu).
- Version 5.14.2
	- A rare possible problem is improved (not completely solved). This problem was reported by Marco Barsotti: for some fixed timetables the generation
	may report incorrectly an impossible timetable. This problem cannot be solved perfectly, only patched, and this will hopefully solve the problem
	in all practical situations.
	- An activity can now be split into 35 (it was previously only 10) - suggested by mohd on the forum.
	- Improved a bit the add/modify activity dialogs (inactive tabs for the components of a subactivity are disabled).
	- Updated the Slovak translation, by Ondrej Gregor.
	- Added a new sample file, by Marco Barsotti.
- Version 5.14.3
	- Upgraded to Qt 4.7.0.
	- Improved the Greek translation, by Dimitris Kanatas.
	- Minor interface improvements.
	- Added two new sample files, by Massimo Mancini and Dimitris Kanatas.
- Version 5.14.4
	- Upgraded to Qt 4.7.2.
	- Updated the French translation, by Regis Bouguin (it is now complete).
	- Added a complete Serbian translation, by Ivan Starchevicy and Radan Putnik.
	- Minor improvements.
	- Added 3 new sample files, by waleed, M K Lohumi and Asti Widayanti.
- Version 5.14.5
	- Updated to Qt 4.7.3.
	- The generate multiple timetable dialog now shows max placed activities for the current timetable and for each timetable with time limit exceeded
	(suggested by Yush Yuen).
	- Non-critical interface bug fix under Mac OS X: in the add and modify activity dialogs, the tab widget for the subactivities was too large, showing
	all the 35 possible components. Bug reported by Yush Yuen.
	- Minor interface bug fix under Mac OS X: the dialogs now show minimize/maximize buttons. Bug reported by Yush Yuen.
	- Minor improvement in the HTML exported timetables (multi-line comments look better), by Volker Dirr.
	- Added a Galician translation, by Juan Marcos Filgueira Gomis (based on the Spanish translation, as of April 2011, by Jose Cesar Fernandez Lopez).
	- Added a Spanish secondary school example file, by llantones.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.15.0
- Version 5.15.0
	- Added two new constraints:
	1) Activities occupy max time slots from selection. This is useful in more cases, for instance to force
	some teachers to have activities in certain time slots. (For example, if in a 5 days week with 6 hours per day, teacher T has 20 hours of
	activities and needs to have activities in the first 3 hours of Monday: add a constraint with all the teacher's activities,
	all time slots minus these 3 (so 5*6-3=27 slots selected in the constraint), and specify the maximum number of selected time slots occupied
	by the selected activities to be 17.) Suggested by Zsolt Udvari, Christian Kemmer, Davide G. M. Salvetti, lalloso, Silver, and maybe other users.
	2) Activities max simultaneous in selected time slots. User chooses a set of activities, a set of time slots, and specifies
	that in each time slot there should be an upper limit on the activities from the chosen set. Useful for example if you want each slot
	to have say at least 3 free teachers, for substitution or supervision.
	- Updated to Qt 4.7.4.
	- Removed dependence of Qt3Support classes. Many dialogs were changed. This is to improve FET and to prepare it for the future Qt 5.
	- The program is now storing the geometry of most dialogs (suggested by more users. Zsolt Udvari suggested to store also the
	Activity planning dialog settings).
	- The activity tags, students, teachers, subjects, rooms, buildings, activities, subactivities, all time constraints
	and all space constraints dialogs contain a draggable splitter, for better viewing (suggested by daviodan).
	- Taking care of when a file was modified. When it was not modified, the user can quit FET directly (suggested by Horatiu Halmajan and maybe other users).
	- Recently used files list (suggested by daviodan, Silver and maybe other users).
	- Activities rooms statistics - it shows the list of activities which will certainly or possibly be scheduled in an unspecified room
	(suggested by Volker Dirr, who also did a part of the coding, Corfiot, Fabio Piedimonte).
	- Removed the upper limit on the number of time and space constraints.
	- When modifying the days or hours, the affected constraints will be modified or removed, after confirmation from the user.
	- Language change is activated without restarting.

	Davide G. M. Salvetti and maybe other users).
	- Each activity may have an optional comment (suggested by K, m and maybe other users).
	- The command line version now saves the current timetable and the highest stage timetable if it receives SIGTERM from the user, then exits
	(suggested by Davide G. M. Salvetti and maybe other users).
	- Added a Vietnamese translation, by Nguyen Truong Thang.
	- Minor interface bug fixes.
	- Updated the Saudi Arabia examination timetable file, by Silver.

- Version 5.18.0
	- Very serious old bug fix. This was found trying to implement the new constraint (see below) in such a way to solve a more complicated file
	by Yush Yuen. Since nobody complained, it seems that until now the bug was not critical (but might have slowed down some timetables which have
	rooms and preferred/home rooms constraints). Bug exists from the start of the implementation of the space allocation in FET, probably.
	A big 'Thank you!' to Yush Yuen, who was very helpful in finding the problem.
	- Added a new constraint, activities occupy max different rooms (which can, for example, constrain some activities to be in the same room
	(in different time slots, of course) if max different rooms = 1). Suggested by Yush Yuen, nomad, Volker Dirr and maybe others.
	- Safe saving of .fet files (save with .fet.tmp name, then remove old .fet file, then rename .fet.tmp to .fet).
	- Saving of the random seed after the end of the generation (in addition to saving it at the beginning).
	- Added an Uzbek translation, by Orzubek Eraliyev.

	- Made generation identical on all computers, by modifying QSet handling in the parts where the generation depends on the order of
	elements in a QSet (the elements are sorted and randomized, then). A minor bug was corrected with this occasion.
