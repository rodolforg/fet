Explanations by Madas Pál:

1.

Gimnázium (secondary school, secondary grammar school) is one of the
most common school types in Hungary. There are 8, 6, and 4-year schools
of this type from the 5th, 7th and 9th grade respectively. There might
be a preparatory language class before the first year; this special year
is between the elementary school and the (usual) secondary school years.

2.

We have the next main groups:

A: six years in the secondary school, they learn Latin for two years,
English for six years – from 07.A to 12.A
B: six years in the secondary school, they learn Latin for two years,
German for six years – from 07.B to 12.B
C: four years in the secondary school, they learn English as the main
foreign language – from 09.C to 12.C
D: four years in the secondary school, they learn English as the main
foreign language– from 09.D to 12.D
ny: language preparatory class, after this special year they will be
E: four (another) years in the secondary school, they learn German or
Spanish as the main foreign language– from 09.E to 12.E

3.

In some cases the classes are split into two groups, eg
07.A-10.A: maths
07-B-10.B: maths
08.A-09.A: informatics
08.B-09.B: informatics
07.A-12.A: English
07.B-12.B: German
ny: German/Spanish; these high lesson/week subjects have several
teachers for the same group
09.C: humanities/music
09.D: maths/physics
10.C: biology/music
10.D: maths/informatics

There is a special case in the 7th year, chemistry: one lesson is for
the whole class, two another for half-half of the class (in another time
slot, because they have the same teacher)

4.

In some cases different classes are merged and then split into smaller
groups.
09.CD-12.CD: there are five English groups each year for the two classes

 From the 9th year every student chooses a second language: five classes
are divided into 10-12 groups, some groups learn English (students from
B, E), some groups learn German (from A, C, D, E/sp), another ones learn
French, Italian or Spanish.

5.

In the 11th and 12th grades the students may (and must) choose two (or
if they want three) subjects with 4 (or 6) supplementary lessons per
week. We call it fakultáció; they (the time slots) are called F5, F6 (or
F7).

6.

PE have occasional merging and splitting (mainly depending on the
numbers of the boys and girls).

7.

I think the constraints for the teachers are not really interesting:
some of them have forbidden time slots. There are a few another
constraints regarding the number of days in the school (as far as I can
remember).

8.

Basically we do not have A and B week, but there are some special
exceptions: I call them féltárgy (half subject): one week with X
(geography), another one with Y (biology). It means that the teachers
affected will surely have a gap in their timetable every second week.
